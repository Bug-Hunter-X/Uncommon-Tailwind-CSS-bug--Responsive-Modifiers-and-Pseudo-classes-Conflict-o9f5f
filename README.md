# Uncommon Tailwind CSS Bug: Responsive Modifiers and Pseudo-classes Conflict

This repository demonstrates a rare bug encountered when using Tailwind CSS responsive modifiers and pseudo-classes together. The bug manifests as unexpected styling or rendering issues under certain conditions.

## Bug Description

The bug occurs when specific responsive modifiers are combined with pseudo-classes (e.g., `:hover`, `:focus`).  The expected styles do not apply, resulting in visual inconsistencies. This often involves complex class combinations and may depend on the order in which the classes are applied.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies (if any).
3. Open `bug.js` (or the relevant file) and observe the unexpected styling. 
4. Examine the `bugSolution.js` (or the relevant file) to understand the fix.

## Solution

The solution often involves restructuring the CSS classes or using Tailwind's utility-first approach to ensure clarity and avoid unexpected interactions between responsive modifiers and pseudo-classes. Specific solutions may involve reordering classes, using more specific selectors, or breaking down complex class combinations into simpler ones.  See `bugSolution.js` for a demonstration.
